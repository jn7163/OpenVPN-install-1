## OpenVPN-install
Secure OpenVPN installer for Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS and Arch Linux.

This script will let you setup your own secure VPN server in just a few minutes.

First, get the script and make it executable :

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hybtoy/OpenVPN-install/openvpn-2.4/openvpn-install.sh
chmod +x openvpn-install.sh
```
Then run it :

`./openvpn-install.sh`

The first time you run it, you'll have to follow the assistant and answer a few questions to setup your VPN server.

When OpenVPN is installed, you can run the script again, and you will get the choice to :

- Add a client
- Remove a client
- Uninstall OpenVPN
